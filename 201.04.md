### CSS Positioning

fixed + absolute = most common

- Static
  - Default position

- Relative:
  - control by top, left, bottom, right. Cascading effect. 
    - position: relative;
    - top: 50px;
  - Moves relative to parents
  - probably going to use with 'absolute'
  - Not something you'll use to move objects around, that's something reserved to parent.

- Absolute
  - what you'll be using.... CHECK RECORDING! 10:58.
  - if you're gonna use absolute, look for its parent..
  - (parent vs. child, not sure where it goes)
  - want to be able to tell the absolute who its parent is

- Fixed
  - it doesn't care about any parents -- like which other one?
  - always going to be fixed to html root element. Listens to the browser window.

## Functions pp. 86-99

### ANATOMY

function sum(a,b){

  return a + b

}

- function - function keyword
- sum - function name/id 
- (a,b) - parameters
  - what you're function is going to take in and do something with. 
  - parameters aren't always necessary, but if you're going to give your function some type of input, you need them.
- return - return statement
- {} - code block

When you call the function -- 'parameters' return/become 'arguments'
