# Growth Mindset

Having a growth mindset means thinking rationally in the face of an obstacle, rather than letting insecurities and emotions dictate our behavior. For example, the fear of making mistakes is irrational, since mistakes are unavoidable, but that fear often manifests as avoidance behaviors. Within a growth mindset, mistakes are seen as opportunities for self-improvement.

## Tips for maintaining a growth mindset

- Take a break: stand up, stretch, hydrate.
- Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- Stop obsessing and just go to bed
