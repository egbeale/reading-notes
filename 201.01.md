# Introductory HTML and Javascript

## HTML

Begin each page with DOCTYPE declaration. Tells browser which version of HTML you want the page to use.

## Attributes : ID vs. CLASS

- **When to use ID?**
  - when you want to distinguuish one element from all other elements on the page. 
  
    - e.j., say you have multiple `<h2>` headings, and there's one that needs to be styled differently from the other h2s. 
    - `<h2 id="coolHeading">`
    - In CSS -- `#coolHeading { }`
    - (Case sensitive)

  - Can be used on any element.

- **When to use Class?**
  - when you want to distinguish more than one element. Elements within the class will all be styled identically.

    - e.j., say you want three images to appear in a row on the page, and they'll all be identical in size, border, shape, etc.
    - `<img class=ImageTrio" src....>`
    - In CSS -- `.ImageTrio { }`
    - Can also be used on any element!

## Block Elements vs. Inline Elements

- Block level elements -- always start on a new line. i.e., the main ones, `<h1>` `<p>` `<ul>` etc. 

- Inline Elements always go on the same as a block elements line, right in middle of the text. 

  -  `<b>` / `<em>` / `<a>` / `<img>`

## Grouping Elements in a Block

- `<div>`
- Group multiple elements together into one section. 
- tip: maybe helpful to add a comment after the closing `</div>` tag.
