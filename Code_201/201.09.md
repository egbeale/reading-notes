#### Browser Events

- Document Events

#### Types

- click
- submit (when a form button is clicked)
- keypresses
- hover
- mouseover
- page load
- etc.

#### JavaScript - Code: Event Listener

- Code will be triggered when the event has been fired or raised
- Asynchronous code -
- Target some sort of HTML element to listen to

```js
let myContainer = document.getElementById('my-container');
```

- specify **what type** of event to listen to
- specify **what to do** when that event happens

  - specify this through **callback function**
    - function that gets passed thru as a function

```js
myContainer.addEventListener('click', handleClick){
  // ___________________________________event handler
  console.log('This item has been clicked')
}
```

#### JavaScript - Code: Event Handler

- grab element
- add "add event listener
- write code to say what you're going to do when event happens

```html 
<form> tag -- delete action tag that emmett gives.
  <fieldset> puts a border around whatever is contained within fieldset. think of it as sections on your form.
    <legend> gives fieldset some context

    - first option:

      <label for="fullName">Full Name:</label>
      <input id="fullName"name="fullName" type="text">
      // if you do them as siblings, label must have for attribute and input must have id, and they must be the same. 
      - "for" helps with accessibility. and it's nice for phone clikcing.

      - second option: nest input inside label tag
      <label>Age
        <input type="number" name="age" id="age">
      </label>

```
