Read: [Local Storage for Web Applications](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

## Reading Notes

- OS provides layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data.
- Persistent local storage -- native client applications have advantage over web applications.

What we want in using local storage:

- a lot of storage space
- on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- and isn't transmitted to the server

Example of use:

- Say you have a game.
- when you close the browser window m id-game, you'll lose your progress.
- With HTML5 Storage -- we can save progress locally, within the browser itself.
  - remember your exact position within game, number of moves you made, your score, whether a particular piece is selected. Exactly where you left off. MAGIC!!
    - Not magic, just storing the values as an object and calling them back as a method. (right?)
- In this particular game example from the article:
  - uses the localStorage object to save whether game is in progress via gGameInProgress (a boolean)
  - If so -- iterates through pieces array and saves row + column numbers of each piece. Also saves other values.
  - THEN on a page load, don't automatically call newGame() function - bc that would reset the variables. INSTEAD, call resumeGame() function.
    - that function checks the boolean to see whether anything is stored locally. If so, it restores those values using the localStorage object.

- Caveat -- Data is stored as strings. So if storing something other than a string, you'll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it.
- so the Boolean gGameInProgress is not stored locally?

# Lecture Notes

## Local Storage

An object that is stored in the browser.

- stored on our hard drive, so specific to one computer
 - no expiration until I clear it

- Other Storage
  - NoSQL - 301 with MongoDB
  - SQL - 401 with postgres

### Why?

- Users can retain data between page refreshes
- Good to test insensitive data before storing it in server or database

### How it's stored

- Data stored as a string
- JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
- `JSON.stringify();`

### METHODS

(it's an object, so we have methods)

- `setItem(key, value)`
  - key has to be a string
- `getItem(key)`
- `clear()`
- `removeItem(key)`

Example, type in console log:
  > `localStorage.setItem('name', 'Eli');`
Application > Local Storage(sidebar) dropdown

## Steps for our project

- First step: set it in local storage
  - `let stringifiedItems = JSON.stringify(array0f0bjs);`
    - when we stringify the objects/data, it changes
    - it will strip away any reference that it came from a constructor.
    - So we stringify it, then we set it.
  - `localStorage.setItem('myItems', stringifiedItems);`
    - // 'myItems' = key

- Get items out of local storage:
  - `localStorage.getItem('myItems');`
    - parse it so that our code can use
  - `JSON.parse(myStuffImGettingOut);`
