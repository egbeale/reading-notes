# My Learning Journal

## About me

Hello! Wow I'm late to this GitHub party... but I'm finally friends with my terminal. Whew. Clearly I'm new to the tech world... I don't even play video games. I am keen on most other games though -- word games, board games, tennis. I also like to paint and sew and create aesthetic things. I considered going the UI/UX design route, but software development seems to align more with my interests and strengths.
