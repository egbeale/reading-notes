## Lecture Notes

Props vs. State

PROPS

- think about it like arguments to a function.
- when you create a component and want to render it, you pass it the props you want to give to it.
- component can't change data from props
- data came from parent

STATE

- data that we can change
- belongs to that specific component and only that specific component can change it.
- owns data

|   STATE      |   PROPS  |
|   -----      |   -----  |
| data that we can change | definition |
| data belongs to that specific component and only that component can change it | data came from parent and component can't change data from props |

```js
let arr = [4,7,9,3];
let strArr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

let newArr = arr.map(num => num * 5);
console.log(newArr);

let newStrArr = strArr.map(str => str.toUpperCase());
console.log(newStrArr);

// This doesn't work well with .map() bc map needs to return something!!
let newStrArr3 = strArr.map(str => {
  if (str !== '') {
    return str.toUpperCase();
  }
});

```js
