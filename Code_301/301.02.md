# Class 02 -- State and Props ğŸ™ƒğŸ™‚

## [React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

**Based off the diagram, what happens first, the 'render' or the 'componentDidMount'?**

- `render` happens first before `componentDidMount. Render examines this.state and this.props when called.

**What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**

- Mounting. When the instance of a component is called, the mounting phase begins.

**Put the following things in the order that they happen:**

1. Constructor
2. render
3. componentDidMount
4. React Updates
5. componentWillUnmount

**What does `componentDidMount` do?**

- initializes the DOM to load data from a remote endpoint.
- invoked immediately after component is mounted.

### [Video - React State vs. Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

**What types of things can you pass in the props?**

- pass data (properties) from one component to another (parent ---> child). Can be string, boolean, number, etc.

**What is the big difference between props and state?**

|   PROPS      |   STATE  |
|   -----      |   -----  |
| Data passed into components from parent. | Data inside component that the component owns (cannot be passed). |
| Handled outside component, changed outside component. | Changed within component but only by that specific component |

-------

**When do we re-render our application?**

- Any time a component is updated or state changes.

**What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**

- Something that will need to be updated based on user input.
- A counter. Inside of a form (input element, checkbox, etc)

## Lecture Notes

```js
let arr = [4,7,9,3];
let strArr = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

let newArr = arr.map(num => num * 5);
console.log(newArr);

let newStrArr = strArr.map(str => str.toUpperCase());
console.log(newStrArr);

// This doesn't work well with .map() bc map needs to return something!!
let newStrArr3 = strArr.map(str => {
  if (str !== '') {
    return str.toUpperCase();
  }
});

```js
