# ES6 Classes

JavaScript objects use `prototype-based inheritance.` Its design is logically similar (but different in implementation) from class inheritance in strictly Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and C#.

- It can be loosely described by saying that `when methods or properties are attached to object’s prototype they become available for use on that object and its descendants, but not directly attached to them.`

When you use `class` and `extends` keywords internally JavaScript will still use prototype-based inheritance. It just simplifies the syntax (this is often called “Syntactic Sugar”). While classes are easier to use, it’s still very important to understand how prototype-based inheritance works. It’s still at the core of the language design.

## <mark>Prototypal Inheritance</mark>

Person

- Attributes: hair color, height, weight
- Behaviors: (verbs): walk(), speak(), drive()

But say you have a certain type of person - a child. Child gets special characteristics but also all the characteristics of a person. That's inheritance. 

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.walk = function() {}

function Bird(name) {
  // I can do all the things animals can do!
  Animal.call(this, name);
}
// Unlike other animals, birds can fly
Bird.prototype.fly = function() {}

// Make a new bird ..
let parrot = new Bird('parrot');
parrot.fly();
parrot.walk();
```

## <mark>ES6 Classes</mark>

The same thing with classes (much cleaner!)

- `function()` becomes `class {}`
- `call()` becomes `extends`

Classes are standalone, self-contained object (instance) factories.

- Ultimately, they result in a prototype.
- But for the developer, they are many orders of magnitude easier to comprehend and work with.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name  = name;
  }

  walk() {}
}

// Thanks to 'extends', all birds can now do all things animals can
class Bird extends Animal {
  // Birds can walk, becuase they're animals also do their own thing.
  fly() {}
}

// Make one (the same was as before, but wasn't the class creation much easier?)
let parrot = new Bird('parrot');
parrot.fly();
parrot.walk();
```

## Notes from [Video on ES6 Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yc5J3Ap9-4)

```js
const Animal = function(name, legs) {
  this.name = name;
  this.legs = legs;
  // this.eat = function() {
  //   this.isEating = true;
  // } -- not efficient. prefer to use prototypes
}
Animal.prototype.walk = function() {
  this.isWalking = true;
}

let puppy = new Animal('blake', 4);
puppy.walk();
console.log(puppy);

// ok ....

let Dog = function(name, legs) {
  Animal.call(this, name, legs) //We want dogs to be animals. So 'this' is calling Animal constructor. and send along 'name' and 'legs'
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
//We want dogs to have all the attributes of an animal. So recreate dog's prototype as a mirror of the animal prototype.

### Constructor Functions & Prototypes:

```js
const Animal = function(name, legs) {
  this.name = name;
  this.legs = legs;
  // second way to add a new method -- inefficient:
  this.eat = function() {
    this.isEating = true;
  }
}

// To add behaviors: one way to do it:
Animal.prototype.walk = function() {
  this.isWalking = true; // set a new attribute
}

// create a new animal (new instance of an animal)

let puppy = new Animal('blake', 4);

console.log(puppy); // Animal { name: blake, legs: 4}

puppy.walk();
console.log(puppy); // Animal {name: blake, legs: 4, isWalking: true}


puppy.walk();
puppy.eat();
console.log(puppy); 
  // Animal {
  //     name: blake,
  //     legs: 4;
  //     eat: [Function],
  //     isWalking: true,
  //     isEating: true },

// So eat method is actually part of the Animal instance "puppy" - it's a first class property
// walk is declared as a prototype function, meaning anything created as an instance of an animal gets to share in whatever the prototype is. So any animal has access to the walk method, but it doesn't actually have to have the walk method as part of its first class properties, meaning much more memory efficient and we can share behaviors instead of actually owning behaviors.
```

```js

const Dog = function(name, legs) {
  Animal.call(this, name, legs);
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

let puppy = new Dog('blake', 4);
puppy.walk();
puppy.eat();
console.log(puppy);
console.log(puppy instanceof Animal);
console.log(puppy instanceof Dog);
```

### ES6 Classes:

```js
class Animal {

  constructor(name, legs) {
    this.name = name;
    this.legs = legs;
  }

  walk() {
    this.isWalking = true;
  }

  eat() {
    this.isEating = true;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

  constructor(name, legs, furType) {
    super(name,legs);
    this.furType = furType;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log('Wooof!');
  }
}

let rosie = new Dog('rosie', 4, 'Short Hair');
rosie.walk();
rosie.eat();
console.log(rosie);
rosie.speak();
```

-----

```js
function Car(options) { // options is an object
  this.title = options.title;
}

let car = new Car ({ title: 'Focus' });

car; // Car { title: 'Focus'}
```

```js
function Car(options) { // options is an object
  this.title = options.title;
}
// add method onto Car. whenever add methods onto a Car class or car prototype, add it to the prototype object of the constructor

Car.prototype.drive = function() {
  return 'vroom';
}

let car = new Car ({ title: 'Focus' });
car.drive();
```

## LECTURE NOTES

```js
// constructor
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.fluffy = true;
}

Cat.prototype.speak = function(){
  console.log(`${this.name} says meow`);
}

// to make a new instance
const bob = new Cat('Bob');
bob.speak();

// class
class Cat {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.fluffy = true;
  }

  speak = () => console.log(`${this.name} says meow`);
}

// to make a new instance
const bob = new Cat('bob');
bob.speak();
```

A good example:

```js
function Musician(artist, style) {
  this.artist = artist;
  this.style = style;
  this.isAmazing = true;
}

let beyonce = new Musician('Beyonce', 'R&B and Soul');
console.log(beyonce);

class MusicianClass {
  constructor(artist, style) {
    this.artist = artist;
    this.style = style;
    this.isAmazing = true;
  }
  awesome = () => {
      console.log('I\'m amazing!');
    }
}

let classBeyonce = new MusicianClass('Beyonce', 'R&B and Soul');
console.log(classBeyonce);

class MusicGroup extends MusicianClass {
  constructor(artist, style, members) {
    super(artist, style);
    this.members = members;
  }
  wow = () => {
      console.log('We\'re amazing!');
  }
}

let beatles = new MusicGroup('Beatles', 'British Rock', ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']);
console.log(beatles);

beatles.awesome();
```
