## Lecture Notes

### Hoisting

```js
function add (2, 3);

function add (a, b){
  return a + b;
}

let myAdd = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let sum2 = myAdd(2, 5);
console.log(sum);
console.log(sum2);
```js

## For-Each

```js
// for-each is a very simple for-loop. allows you to write less code.

let arr = [4, 2, 3];
let newArr = [];

for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  newArr.push(arr[i]);
}
// OR CAN WRITE AS //
arr.forEach((num) => {
  newArr.push(num);
});
//num is telling forEach to call each item that you iterate through a "num" let num = "the item you are dealing with at the moment"

```js

## REACT
