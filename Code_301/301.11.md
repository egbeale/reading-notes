## [SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL | NoSQL |
| ... | ... |
| Relational databases | non-relational databases |
| Table-based | Document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases |
| have predefined schema | have dynamic structures|
| vertically scaleable | horizontally scalable |
| use SQL | focus queries on collections of documents |

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? **A table**

- **Real world example of SQL data:** A group of things all under one heading, like products.

What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database? **key value pairs**

- **Real world example of NoSQL data:** JSON

Best for **hierarchical data storage** NoSQL

Best for **scalability:** SQL

**SQL** Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?** A database that works in a specific way with SQL

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?** Tables

**What is a `schema`?** The defined fields for the data

**What is a NoSQL database?** can store lots of data efficiently

**How does it work?** uses collections rather than tables

**What is inside of a Mongo database?** Documents in a similar form to JSON.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why?** MongoDB, because you can change which data you're getting as you go, and still have it in the same collection with no relations.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?** You can't rely on your record having a specific field since it is schema-less
