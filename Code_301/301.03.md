# Class 3 - Passing Functions as Props üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

## Lists and Keys - [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

**What does <mark>`.map()`</mark> return?**

- `.map()` returns a new array after iterating through an existing array.

**How to loop through an array and display each value in JSX in React:**

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
let newArr = arr.map(num => <li>{num}</li>);
```

... then you can place the array of items into a list using `<ul>{newArr}</ul>`. (usually this would be rendered inside a component)

**What is the purpose of a key?**

- Keys help React render lists by identifying which elements have been changed, added, or removed. Keys are given to the elements inside our previous array in order to give them a stable identity.
- Each list item needs a unique key.
- Best way to assign a key is to use `idx` (grabs the index of the element) or `id` - (grabs an ID from your data).
- When you assign a key, it only matters in the context of the surrounding array, so it should be on the component rather than on the list item.
- put key on the root jsx tag being returned from our map statement. Like this:

  - `<li key={callback.id}>` or `<img key={image.id}>`

- They only have to be unique with siblings. It can be the same keys within different array.

## [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

- Spread syntax is an elipsis `...` that allows us to add onto arrays and objects

- `let newArray = [...oldArray, 1, 2]` - new items in array
- `let newObject = {...oldObject, newProperty: 5}` - new key-value pairs in object

**List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**

- combine objects
- add to state in React
- add an item to a list
- use an array as an argument
- copy an array. concatenate or combine arrays
- use Math functions
- convert NodeList to an array

**Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array?**

```js
let someNums = [1, 2, 3];
let newNum = 9;
let allNums = [...someNums, newNum]
```

**Give example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one?**

```js
let person = {
  name: 'Eggbert',
  age: 99
}
let job = {
  title: 'Software Developer',
  location: 'Seattle'
}

let employee = {...person,...job};
```

## [Video - How to pass functions between components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)

**What is the first step that the dev does to pass functions between components?**

- He first creates a function where the state is located (outside the render) and uses the `map()` method on the array.

**What does the <mark>`increment`</mark> function do?**

- The increment function fires when the add button is clicked. At that point, the function begins with the parameter of name (in this.state people array). It will map this.state.people and iterate through the array.
- The callback is p, which he assigns an `if statement` to. If the name strictly equals to any of the iterations then it will run the code on that iteration.
- The count property for that iteration will then increment by 1(++) every time the button is clicked.
- Lastly, the new state of p (the callback) is returned and the UI is updated to display the new result using setState.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**

- Since a method exists in the component, we can pass it like we would a prop - `increment = {this.increment}`

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**

- lets you evaluate each element in the array, perform an operation, return true or false, and build a new array of arbitrary size out of those array elements.
