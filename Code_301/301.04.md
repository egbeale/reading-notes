# Class 4 -- React and Forms

## [FORMS ðŸ“„](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

### Controlled Component

- When the form data is handled by the component's state, this becomes a controlled component. The component's state is the defining source of what happens in and out of the form.

Should we: ~~wait to store the user's responses from the form into state when they submit the form~~ OR **update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them?**

- We should update the state with the user's responses as soon as they're entered because if we're passing this info to other components they'll need to be updated too.

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**

- We'll target the state of the component as the values are passed in. As the values are put into the state is updated. So we'll pass it <mark>this.state.value:</mark>

```js
<input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}/>
```

<mark>event.target</mark> delgates the event here (here being the input). The even is every key stroke within the input. Value is what's being updated to state for whatever we want to do with it.

## [Conditional (Ternary) Operator](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**

- Shorten if statements / test multiple conditions

### Rewrite this statement using ternary statement:

```js
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

rewritten:

```js
x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log (false);
```
