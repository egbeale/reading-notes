# Class 8 - APIs

REST: Representational State Transfer

REST APIs are designed around a **resource**.

- A resource has an identifer called a URI (Uniform Resource Id). URIs uniquely identify that resource. An example of a good URI is 'shirts' in `http://clothes.com/shirts`

Most common HTTP verbs: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

URIs should be based on resources (nouns) and not the operations of the resources (verbs)

**Example of a good URI:** `https://codefellows.com/course-calendar/`

A chatty web API is one that has a lot of requests. The more requests, the bigger the work load and the slower it becomes. This is a bad thing.

A successful `GET` request returns status code **200. All good.**

An unsuccessful `GET` request returns status code **404. Not found.**

A successful `POST` request returns status code **200 or 204**

A successful `DELETE` request returns status code **204. No content.**

## Lecture

Lab

- Use express.js to create a server
- add dotenv
- add cors
- deploy server to heroku
- connect our react app on netlify to backend at heroku
- use classes to simplify bulky incoming data

Tools:

**Node**

- JS runtime (environment): a popular way to run servers in js
- node = open-source, _cross-platform_, back-end js runtime environment.

**NPM**

- node's package manager. how we install diff node code into our node code. axios is a node project.

**Express.js**

- a node package that we're going use to build a server.

Notes

server - basically another person's computer
