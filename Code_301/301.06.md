# Class 6 - NODE.JS

## [Intro to node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

**Node.js**

"Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built using Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine." It can be used to execute JavaScript on the computer rather than in the browser. This means Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on a server. It can also add, delete, and modify data in a database. It also generates page contents.

**Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine**

The V8 engine is bascially a compiler for Javascript that can handle memory, provide the data types, operators, object, and functions. It's written in C++

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

It can run JavaScript alongside everything needed for it to work.

**What is npm?**

"Node Package Manager." Allows you to control what version of Node is running with your code and install dependancies for projects.

**What version of node are you running on your machine?**

`node -v`  I'm runnning v17.6.0

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

`nvm -v` -- I'm running 8.5.1

**What command would ou type to install a library/package called jshint?**

`npm install -g jshint`

**What is node used for?**

- Installing and running various build tools that automate the process of developing Javascipt apps.
- Runs various tests on code.
- Automates code linting and style checking.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Efficiency
2. Collaboration
3. Learning
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

**Which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

- Engaged collaboration. It helps me stay on track and not lose focus.

**How does pair programming work?**

Pair programming involves two roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver handles the "mechanics" -- i.e., types the code. The navigator thinks about the logic and dictates to the driver what to write.
