# Class 9 - Modularization, Refactoring

[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

**Functional programming** is a process of building software that relies exclusively on functions. Developers compose functions to create new functions and write applications to avoid aspects such as shared state.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?** Pure functions will return the same result if given the same arguments. It's pure when it requires a return statement.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?** Pure functions have reliable output and are independent of outside state, meaning you don't have to worry about shared state and they're easier to refactor.

**Immutability** means the object's state cannot be modified.

**Referential transparency** means the expression can be replaced with its value without changing the code.

**Modules:** are split-up pieces of code that do specific tasks. They seem similar in function to components on the front-end.

**The word ‘require’** looks in a module for the exports property and returns it.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?** Require the module first and then export the code from the module and set the require to a new variable.
