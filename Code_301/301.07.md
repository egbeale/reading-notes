[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

- He helped write the first servers that sent documents across the internet.

**Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk about all of the  machines in the world?**

- They weren't designed to do so; they were designed to talk to a small group of computers.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- The HTTP protocol created by Fielding uses GET to obtain things based on their URL (it applies verbs to nouns).

`GET` looks for a computer-readable resource.

`POST` adds something to another system

`PUT` replaces something in another system. 

`PATCH` partially updates something in another system
