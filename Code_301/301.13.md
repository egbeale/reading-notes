**Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?**

- `PUT` replaces all current data with the new data.

**REST** vs. **CRUD**

- They both create, modify, delete information
- `CRUD` : 4 basic functions that can be performed on database applications.
- `REST` : is an architectural style for APIs. controls data through http commands.
- `CRUD` operations should be performable by a `REST`ful API.

| **CRUD** | **HTTP methods (REST)** |
| CREATE | POST/PUT | creates a new record in the database |
| READ | GET | grabs data based on input parameters / reads information sourced from db | 
| UPDATE | PUT/PATCH | updates an object |
| DELETE | DELETE | removes data from database |

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

- Install and require necessary libraries.
- Give the necessary routes for each REST/CRUD operation
- Link it to database.
- Test routes.
