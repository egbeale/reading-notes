# Programming with Javascript

## JS Functions

- function parameters are listed inside parentheses in the function definition

- function **arguments** are values received by the function when it's invoked.

- inside the function, the arguments (parameters) behave as local variables.

### Invoking Functions

the code inside the function will execute when "something' invokes aka calls it.

    - when an event occurs (user clicks button)
    - when it's called from code
    - automatically (self invoked)

### Function Return

when js reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

if function was invoked from a statement, js will "return" to execute the code after invoking the statement. functions can compute a return value
