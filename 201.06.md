## Object Literals (pp. 100-105)

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something. 
- In an object, variables and functions take on new neames and become known as properties.
  - When a variable is part of an object, it's called a property.
  - When a function is part of an object, it's called a method.
    - methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.
