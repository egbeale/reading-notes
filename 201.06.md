## Object Literals (pp. 100-105)

- Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something. 
- In an object, variables and functions take on new neames and become known as properties.
  - When a variable is part of an object, it's called a property.
  - When a function is part of an object, it's called a method.
    - methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.

## Objects

`let personArray = ['Eli', true, 31, 'Student'];`

### JS Built in Objects

- Array, String, Document, Math

- object.notation
  
- method call -- objectName.method() to evoke

```js
let Eli = {
  name: 'Eli',
  age: 35,
  isRemote: true,
  title: 'Student'
  says: function(){
    console.log('Hey class!')
  }
};
console.log(Eli.name);
console.log(Eli.age);
```

#### Adding to Objects

- `Eli.interests = ['sleeping', 'camping', 'reading'];

- using THIS
  - refers to object you're in.
  - this.age = 25;

Another example:

- we can have keys that are numbers? but in order to call it, you need to bracket notation and keep it as a string.

```js
let animal = {
  type: 'cat',
  name: 'pat',
  'is sweet': true,
  8: 'age'
}
console.log(animal['5']);
console.log(animal['is a jerk']);
```
