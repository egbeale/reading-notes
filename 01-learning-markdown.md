## Headings

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.




> # # Heading 1

> ## ## Heading 2

> ### ### Heading 3

## Paragraphs

- To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

## Line Breaks
- To create a line break or new line (< br >), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
- You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial. It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence.

## Bold

- add two asterisks or underscores before and after word/phrase.

## Italic

- add one asterisk or underscore before and after word
