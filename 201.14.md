[What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

Are the best teams made up of people with similar interests?

or 

Does it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards?

### Group Norms

- Traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather
- One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink.

- May behave in certain ways as individuals — but when in a group, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.

- sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group

### Collective I.Q.

- what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. 
- The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence

### Behaviors of good teams

- members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’

- Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

- psychological safety -- most important

- clear goals

- culture of dependability
